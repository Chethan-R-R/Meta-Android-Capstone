### I designed and developed restaurant app  as part of the Meta Android Professional Course. This app comprises three screens:

* Onboarding Screen: Collects user information during the initial setup.
* Home Screen: Displays a list of menu items data fetched from servers using Ktor, allowing users to search and browse by category, all stored efficiently in SQLite using Room.
* User Profile Screen: Provides a user profile view.
  
## Technologies Used
* Kotlin
* Android Jetpack Compose
* Ktor
* SQLite Room
* Figma
